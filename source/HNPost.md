I'm a polyglot that loves learning and breaking things (what better way to learn) I have built my own frameworks https://github.com/eldr-rb/eldr, https://github.com/ryggrad and written books https://leanpub.com/u/k2052, http://buildYourOwnSinatra.com. I attack projects that interest me with tremendous energy, and I find most things interesting.
