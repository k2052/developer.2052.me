# What is this?

This is the source for [iDoDevStuff](http://idodevstuff.me). It is 99% static and is built using
[middleman](http://middlemanapp.com).

You are free to utilize and learn from anything (Licensed under MIT). Feel free to deploy a site using
this as a starting point, just change the design and images enough that it doesn't interfere with my brand (i.e confuse people).
