# Intro

 Hi, I'm Ken and I do development stuff. I'm [both good at it](http://github.com/bookworm) and [completely obsessed](http://coderwall.com/bookworm). Lets get to know each other a bit. 

# My Core Skills 

  # Web APPs
    Good web apps start with good code. I create web apps with a simple well thought-out base that grows well. I love starting
    with great REST API, good tests & then growing it from there until I get full fledged web app.

  # Frontends  
    The web is everywhere & HTML/CSS/JS skills more important now than ever. I know the latest and greatest techniques from 
    compass to coffescript to spine.js. Hell with stuff like parse & firebase a backend isn't even necessary. Let's set the web a flame with awesomeness.

  # CMS Templates/Themes
    I've written a [Joomla! template framework](http://github.com/simplex) & I've done work for many Joomla! template clubs. I'm an exert at producing templates that are cleanly coded & that sell well.
