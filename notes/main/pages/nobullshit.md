That's great you can do stuff but can you do stuff for us?

Everyone has lines about their hardworking get, up and go attitude I'm creative, I'm excited to work for you. But no bullshit here. I'm fucking lazy, I'll be constantly looking for ways to get the real work done faster so I can focus on the stuff that actually interests me. 

Sometimes I'll get carried away on my own shit & push your stuff further than the last minute. If you want me to obsess on your stuff keep me interested & I'll be less likely to venture forth. Better yet let me take control & impose interesting stuff on your project. The stuff you thought was a waste of time for me to work on? The stuff that goes into version 30 a year from now? Yeah that stuff, let me work on it now. It'll keep me interested. Because something is not a waste of time if it makes me more productive.    

I'll write very detailed email's to 

I'll meticulously document my code like some sort of freak.  I like to learn and I'm not afraid of looking like an idiot. I'm also damn good at it, the learning not the idiot part. I'm a former draughts prodigy and a strong chess player. I was world #2 in Suicide 8X8 Draughts (played match for world title at 14), #2 junior in USA 8x8 Draughts, was the strongest under 18 chess player from North Idaho. I've been self-taught since the age of Nine. I even document my learning in github repos.   

When I say personal issues it really means I'm stressed out of mind from shitty people bugging me constantly. I'm actually sitting at home playing chess trying to disconnect from the world that wont leave me alone.
